## Description
Allow users to export the current contract storage state to a JSON file after execution, and import a previously saved snapshot to pre-seed storage before a debug session — making it easy to reproduce exact on-chain state locally.

## Requirements
- `--export-storage <file>` saves full storage state after execution
- `--import-storage <file>` loads state into host before execution
- JSON format that is human-readable and manually editable
- Round-trip: export then import produces identical state

## Suggested Execution
1. Branch: `git checkout -b feature/storage-snapshot-io`
2. Add `--export-storage` and `--import-storage` flags to `src/cli/args.rs`
3. Implement serialization/deserialization in `src/inspector/storage.rs`
4. Load imported storage into host environment before execution
5. Add round-trip tests
6. Commit: `feat: add storage snapshot import/export`

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] `--export-storage` saves all storage keys and values to JSON
- [ ] `--import-storage` correctly pre-seeds storage
- [ ] Exported JSON is human-readable and editable
- [ ] Round-trip test (export → import → execute) passes
- [ ] Tests included
